# Javacsript Web Application exercises

This is a repository for the exercises of the makers course [Javascript Web Applications](https://github.com/makersacademy/javascript-web-applications#sequence) section.

They are kept for reference and revision purposes and are not designed to be run as individual applications.

This section of the course was a week long module as the second week of JS learning.
